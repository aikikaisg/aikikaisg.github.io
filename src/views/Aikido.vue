    <p>Aikido(锟较氾拷锟?锟斤拷锟斤拷锟斤拷锟缴わ拷, also written as 锟较気碉拷:锟斤拷锟斤拷锟斤拷锟缴わ拷) is a gendai budo, a modern Japanese martial art, developed by Morihei Ueshiba. The art consists of striking, body throw and joint locking techniques and is known for its fluidity and blending with an attacker, rather than meeting force with force</p>

    <p>The word aikido is formed of three Japanese characters,</p>

    <p>锟斤拷 - ai - joining</p>
    <p>锟斤拷 - ki - spirit</p>
    <p>锟斤拷 - do - way</p>

    <p>Aiki is a martial arts principle or tactic. It typically describes an idea of oneness or blending in the midst of combat. This principle finds expressions in such lethal concepts as ai-uchi (ai-uchi), meaning "mutual strike/kill", but in aikido it generally describes the more elevated notion of blending rather than clashing. The emphasis is upon joining with the rhythm and intent of the opponent in order to find the optimal position and timing with which to apply the technique.</p>

    <p>The techniques of Aikido can, when applied judiciously, divert or immobilize rather than damage or kill. As a result, some consider aikido to be a practical symbol of meeting aggression (physical, verbal, etc.) with an effective but merciful response, and finding harmony in conflict. Ueshiba declared, "To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace."</p>
